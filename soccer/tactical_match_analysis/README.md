# Match Physical Demands & Role-Based Analysis

## Research Question

What are the physical demands of a UNC women’s soccer match, and how does playing time shape those demands?

## Audience

- Head coaches
- Strength & conditioning staff
- Performance analysts
- Player development staff

## Key Metrics

External load:
- Total distance (m)
- High-intensity running distance (Speed Zone 5)
- Sprint distance (Speed Zone 6)
- Accelerations and decelerations

Normalized metrics:
- Distance per minute
- High-intensity distance per minute
- Sprint distance per minute
- Accelerations per minute
- Decelerations per minute

Role classification:
- Starters vs substitutes (based on minutes played)

## Methodology

1. Merge GPS datasets across multiple matches.
2. Estimate minutes played using distance and meters/minute.
3. Normalize physical metrics by playing time.
4. Compare starters and substitutes using statistical summaries and visualizations.
5. Identify outliers and variability in match demands.

## Key Visualizations

- Boxplots of total distance by role
- Intensity metrics per minute (starters vs subs)
- Sprint and acceleration distributions
- Acceleration vs deceleration scatterplots
- Player-level outlier identification

## Insights & Applications

This analysis helps answer:
- How match workload differs between starters and substitutes
- Whether substitutes exhibit higher intensity due to shorter playing time
- Which players experience unusually high physical demands
- How coaches might interpret workload when making substitution decisions
