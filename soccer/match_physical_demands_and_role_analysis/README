# Section 1 – Match Physical Demands & Role Analysis

## Objective
Understand **the physical demands of a UNC Women’s Soccer match** and how **playing time and role (starter vs sub) influence output**.

---

## Visualizations
- **Total Distance by Player/Role:** Boxplots, violin plots  
- **High-Intensity Distance per Minute:** Scatterplots  
- **Sprints, Accelerations, Decelerations per Minute:** Bar charts  
- **Minutes Played Distribution:** Histogram  

---

## Key Insights to Communicate
- Who covers the most distance / high-intensity distance?  
- How do starters vs substitutes compare?  
- Are there outliers (high or low performers)?  
- How do physical outputs scale with playing time?
