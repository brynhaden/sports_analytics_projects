# Soccer Analytics Projects

This folder contains soccer-specific analytics projects using NCAA and publicly available professional data.

## Core Themes

The projects focus on four major areas:

1. Match Physical Demands & Role-Based Analysis  
2. Speed Profile & Playing Style Analysis  
3. Training Load & Injury Risk Signals  
4. Pro vs Team/Position Performance Comparison  

Additional projects explore tactical analysis, set pieces, xG models, and player development.

## Data Sources

- NCAA women’s soccer GPS and performance data
- Public NWSL and MLS datasets
- Research literature in sports science and performance analytics

## Analytical Goals

These projects aim to answer questions such as:

- What are the physical demands of a soccer match?
- How does playing time shape intensity and workload?
- How do players differ in speed and movement profiles?
- What distinguishes professional-level performance?
- How can workload metrics inform injury risk?

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and transformation
